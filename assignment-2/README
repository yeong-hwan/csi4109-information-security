Assignment 2 - MAC
2019145019 장영환

I set security level 'unclassifed' to 'top_secret' -> 0 to 3 respectively.
and store pair with 'username':'security level' at struct by reading mac.policy.

First, branch out based on the file you want to read.
After that, I chose to branch out read and write once more to check the user's level and decide whether to allow or reject.
