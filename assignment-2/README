I set security level 'unclassifed' to 'top_secret' -> 0 to 3 respectively.
and store pair with 'username':'security level' at struct by reading mac.policy.

First, branch out based on the file's name to check.
After that, branch out read and write once more to check the user's level
Lastly, decide whether to allow or reject by comparing user level and docs level.
